## Live Demo

The project is deployed on Alibaba Cloud ECS:

[http://47.77.201.239:8000/index.php](http://47.77.201.239:8000/index.php)

The public demo is protected with a temporary `JAH_API_KEY` login to prevent unauthorized Qwen Cloud API usage. The Qwen credential remains server-side and is never exposed to the browser, repository, or public documentation. Judge access is provided privately through the Devpost testing instructions.

JAH MemoryAgent is a persistent-memory AI agent built in pure PHP. It learns durable user preferences and project facts across sessions, retrieves only relevant memories for a limited Qwen context window, and forgets information through persistent tombstones. Its internal ActionScript PHP runtime coordinates security, classification, retrieval, Qwen inference, storage, migration, and audit actions.

The project uses no Node.js, npm, Java, or browser JavaScript. Internal configuration and storage use PHP arrays and JAH/PHP serialization. JSON is isolated inside `app/QwenConnector.php` only because the Qwen Cloud compatible API requires it at the external boundary.

## Why this is a MemoryAgent

The Track 1 requirements are implemented directly:

| MemoryAgent requirement | JAH implementation |
|---|---|
| Persistent cross-session memory | Append-only `DataCoreTurbo` storage and persistent JAH indexes |
| Immediate conversational context | Hot keeps active dialogue; older sections of long conversations remain in Warm for seven days |
| Accumulated experience | Every meaningful interaction is classified and may become a durable memory |
| User preference memory | Preference, workflow, identity, and project signals receive explicit classifications |
| Efficient retrieval | SHA-256 direct pointers, persistent inverted term/prefix index, ranked candidates, deduplication, and bounded results |
| Timely forgetting | Tombstones override canonical and archived copies so deleted memories cannot reappear |
| Limited context windows | At most 10 relevant memories are reduced to 280-character excerpts before Qwen inference |
| Cross-session improvement | Stored facts are recalled on later requests and incorporated into the next Qwen decision |

## Core capabilities

- Pure PHP ActionScript registry with required parameters, execution budgets, result envelopes, and traces.
- Persistent Hot / Warm / Cold memory lifecycle.
- Human conversational memory: Hot keeps the active thread, Warm keeps temporary history for seven days, and Cold stores permanent explicitly requested or highly important knowledge.
- Collection isolation for independent users, agents, or workspaces.
- Meaningful-memory classifier that rejects greetings, noise, transient questions, secrets, and forget commands.
- Reusable-knowledge classifier that persists Qwen-generated book summaries and their source query instead of saving only the prompt; repeated requests update one deterministic memory instead of creating duplicates.
- Secret detection, output masking, security preflight, audit journal, API access control, and CSRF protection.
- Atomic append-only writes, O(1)-style direct ID pointers, persistent inverted postings, rare-first query planning, automatic index rebuilding, concurrent locking, and compressed cold records.
- Qwen Cloud connection through native PHP cURL with explicit connect and request timeouts.
- Plain-text `JAH_RESPONSE` API plus a server-rendered PHP interface with no JavaScript.

Technical deep dives:

- [`DATACORE_ARCHITECTURE.md`](DATACORE_ARCHITECTURE.md) — record format, direct pointers, inverted postings, consistency, rebuilding, and complexity.
- [`ACTIONSCRIPT_ARCHITECTURE.md`](ACTIONSCRIPT_ARCHITECTURE.md) — action DSL, execution envelopes, official pipeline, security gates, and traces.

Hot and unexpired Warm turns are loaded together to preserve conversational
coherence. Warm expires after seven days and never becomes Cold automatically.
Cold has no time expiration. The Qwen prompt is size-bounded independently.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or newer.
- PHP cURL extension for Qwen Cloud.
- PHP zlib extension for Cold memory compression.
- A Qwen Cloud API key.
- Write access to the configured runtime and session paths.
- Optional: PCNTL for parallel worker execution; it is not required by the official request path.

No Composer, Node.js, npm, Java, database server, or frontend build process is required.

## Installation

### Automated Alibaba Cloud ECS installation (`deploy_alibaba_ecs.sh`)

The recommended deployment path is the included executable installer:

- [`deploy_alibaba_ecs.sh`](deploy_alibaba_ecs.sh)

It is designed for a clean **Alibaba Cloud Linux 3 ECS** instance and must be run as `root`. No Docker, Composer, Node.js, npm, Java, or external database is required.

Install Git, clone the public repository, and run the script:

```bash
dnf install -y git
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/esmeydub/jah-php.git
cd /root/jah-php
chmod 755 deploy_alibaba_ecs.sh
./deploy_alibaba_ecs.sh
```

The script performs the complete deployment sequence:

1. Verifies `root`, Alibaba Cloud Linux 3, `dnf`, and the x86-64 environment.
2. Installs Git, cURL, unzip, PHP 8.2, and the required PHP extensions.
3. Requests `QWEN_API_KEY` and `JAH_API_KEY` using hidden terminal input.
4. Writes both keys only to the ignored `.env` with mode `0600`; neither key is embedded in the script or committed to Git.
5. Prepares persistent DataCoreTurbo, MemoryPyramid, session, audit, and deployment directories.
6. Validates the PHP source and runs the complete `18/18` product suite and `7/7` ActionScript suite.
7. Installs and enables `jah-memoryagent.service` with `systemd` on port 8000.
8. Executes live status, Qwen, cross-session memory, retrieval, search, and SALK checks.
9. Creates a secret-free report at `runtime/deployment/alibaba-ecs-proof.txt`.
10. Prints the service, logs, local URL, and the SSH tunnel command used for optional private validation.

The credential prompts look like this; typed values are not displayed:

```text
Pega tu QWEN_API_KEY (entrada oculta):
Crea una JAH_API_KEY de al menos 16 caracteres (entrada oculta):
```

Verify the completed deployment:

```bash
systemctl status jah-memoryagent --no-pager -l
ss -ltnp | grep ':8000'
cat /root/jah-php/runtime/deployment/alibaba-ecs-proof.txt
journalctl -u jah-memoryagent -n 100 --no-pager -l
```

Expected summaries in the generated proof:

```text
SUMMARY 18/18
SUMMARY 7/7
```

#### Current public judging deployment

The hackathon judging deployment is currently available at:

```text
http://47.77.201.239:8000/index.php
```

Inbound TCP 8000 is temporarily authorized in the Alibaba Cloud ECS Security Group for evaluation. The interface remains protected with `JAH_API_KEY`; the temporary judge key is provided only through Devpost's private testing instructions. `QWEN_API_KEY` remains on the server and is never sent to the browser.

After judging, remove the public TCP 8000 rule and rotate the temporary judge key.

#### Historical SSH tunnel used during private testing

Before enabling the public judging endpoint, deployment validation and video recording used an SSH local-forward while port 8000 remained closed to the Internet:

```bash
ssh -N -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 root@ECS_PUBLIC_IP
```

The tester then opened `http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.php`. That tunnel was used only for private testing and is not required for current judge access. No SSH password, private key, Qwen key, or JAH key belongs in the repository.

For current deployment evidence and the historical tunnel explanation, see [`ALIBABA_CLOUD_PROOF.md`](ALIBABA_CLOUD_PROOF.md).

### Manual local installation

Clone the public repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/esmeydub/jah-php.git
cd jah-php
cp .env.example .env
```

Configure at least:

```dotenv
QWEN_API_KEY=
QWEN_MODEL=qwen-max
QWEN_BASE_URL=https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1

# Required for remote access. Use a long random value.
JAH_API_KEY=
```

Start the pure PHP server:

```bash
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t public
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/index.php`. When `JAH_API_KEY` is configured, the PHP interface presents a server-side login form. Without it, access is restricted to loopback clients.

## API examples

All mutation actions use POST. Remote requests include `X-JAH-API-Key` or an `Authorization: Bearer` header.

Status:

```bash
curl -H "X-JAH-API-Key: $JAH_API_KEY" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api.php?action=status"
```

Save a durable preference:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-JAH-API-Key: $JAH_API_KEY" \
  -d "action=save" \
  -d "collection=demo-user" \
  -d "id=preferred-language" \
  -d "content=The user prefers concise answers in Spanish" \
  -d "tier=hot" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api.php"
```

Search relevant memory:

```bash
curl -H "X-JAH-API-Key: $JAH_API_KEY" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api.php?action=search&collection=demo-user&query=Spanish"
```

Run the full MemoryAgent:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-JAH-API-Key: $JAH_API_KEY" \
  -d "action=chat" \
  -d "collection=demo-user" \
  -d "conversation_id=demo-thread" \
  -d "message=How should you answer me?" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api.php"
```

Send a follow-up with the same `conversation_id`; JAH loads recent Hot turns even when the new words do not overlap the previous question:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-JAH-API-Key: $JAH_API_KEY" \
  -d "action=chat" \
  -d "collection=demo-user" \
  -d "conversation_id=demo-thread" \
  -d "message=And who wrote it?" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api.php"
```

Forget a memory:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-JAH-API-Key: $JAH_API_KEY" \
  -d "action=forget" \
  -d "collection=demo-user" \
  -d "id=preferred-language" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api.php"
```

Rebuild and compact a collection's DataCore indexes:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-JAH-API-Key: $JAH_API_KEY" \
  -d "action=reindex" \
  -d "collection=demo-user" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api.php"
```

## Security model

- `QWEN_API_KEY` is sent only in Qwen's `Authorization` header.
- `JAH_API_KEY` protects remote API access and the PHP interface.
- The interface uses server-side sessions, SameSite cookies, and CSRF tokens.
- SALK blocks known keys, bearer tokens, passwords, credentials, and secret-bearing memory payloads.
- Public responses and ActionScript traces are recursively masked.
- Serialized input disables PHP object reconstruction with `allowed_classes=false`.
- Mutations require POST; request sizes, action names, model names, IDs, and collections are bounded or sanitized.
- DataCore uses file locks, atomic offsets, encoded indexes, and persistent tombstones.
- Runtime memory and `.env` are excluded from version control.

## Tests and reproducibility

Run the MemoryAgent product suite:

```bash
php tests/run.php
```

Expected result:

```text
SUMMARY 18/18
```

Run the ActionScript PHP suite:

```bash
php php_actionscript_php_doc/tests/run.php
```

Expected result:

```text
SUMMARY 7/7
```

The product tests cover API access keys, CSRF, generated book-summary memory, Hot conversational continuity, Hot→Warm overflow, seven-day Warm expiration, permanent Cold memory, bounded Qwen context, collection isolation, forgetting, sensitive-field rejection, indexes, search metrics, replication and worker correctness.

## DataCore performance

DataCore v3 moves retrieval work from full segment scans to two persistent pure-PHP structures:

1. SHA-256 selects one of 256 compact pointer journals that maps each collection and document ID to its latest binary segment and byte offset.
2. An inverted index maps normalized exact terms and prefixes to recent document IDs. Stale postings are safe because the current pointer and tombstone are always verified before returning a result.

Indexes rebuild automatically when existing v1/v2 data is opened. They can also be compacted explicitly through the `memory.reindex` ActionScript action or the POST API action `reindex`.

Reproducible benchmark:

```bash
php tests/benchmark.php 10000
```

Measured locally with PHP 8.4 and 10,000 synthetic memories:

| Operation | Scan-based baseline | Indexed DataCore v3 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Missing-term search | 29.28 ms | 0.033 ms |
| Rare-term search | 29.28 ms worst-case scan | 0.120 ms |
| Common-term search, 20 results | 29.28 ms | 7.021 ms |
| Retrieve latest document by ID | 1.488 ms | 0.073 ms |
| Indexed write cost | 0.024 ms/document baseline | 0.160 ms/document |

The index intentionally trades about 0.14 ms of additional write work per document for large read-latency gains. At 10,000 documents, sharding keeps the complete index near 9.7 MB and 523 files instead of creating one filesystem entry per ID and numeric term. MemoryAgent writes one durable memory at a time but searches on every agent turn, so this read-optimized tradeoff matches the product workload. Results vary by filesystem and hardware.

### Demo video

[JAH MemoryAgent — Qwen Cloud and Alibaba ECS demo (2:58)](https://youtu.be/3H8MfxC-SFY)

## Suggested three-minute demo

1. **0:00–0:25 — Problem and architecture:** show the diagram and explain cross-session memory.
2. **0:25–1:00 — Preference learning:** tell the agent a durable preference and show the classification trace.
3. **1:00–1:35 — Cross-session recall:** start a new session and show the preference affecting Qwen's answer.
4. **1:35–2:05 — Limited-context retrieval:** show relevant memory selection, deduplication, and context count.
5. **2:05–2:30 — Forgetting:** delete the preference and prove it no longer appears from Hot, Warm, or Cold storage.
6. **2:30–2:50 — Engineering:** show ActionScript PHP, DataCore, SALK, tests, and Qwen Cloud integration.
7. **2:50–3:00 — Impact:** position JAH as an embeddable memory layer for PHP applications.

## Product value

Most memory-agent examples depend on a large framework stack or external vector database. JAH offers a small, auditable, open-source alternative for existing PHP products: one runtime, no package manager, no database service, persistent forgetting, collection isolation, and a direct Qwen Cloud boundary. The design can be embedded in customer-support systems, personal assistants, learning platforms, internal knowledge tools, and long-running workflow agents.
